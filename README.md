# Arena-Tracker
Arena Tracker reads the Hearthstone log to keep track of your arena deck, games and rewards.
* Draft with HearthArena advice.
* Upload your stats to your ArenaMastery account.
* Go over your deck while you play.
* Get value info of enemy's hand. Cards sent back from the board, spare parts or the coin (among others).
* Test enemy secrets. Watch the remaining posibilities while you make your moves.

Arena Tracker is free and open source. Made by one person(me) in his spare time.

My Hearthstone ID: triodo#2541 (EU region)

If you like the app, donations are much appreciated. It allows me to spend more time developing Arena Tracker.

## FAQ
* I started a new arena and ArenaTracker didn't help me with the draft.
 * When you start a new arena in hearthstone a draft tab will appear in ArenaTracker. You have to select the hero to start the draft. The correct moment to click the hero is after having selected the hero in Hearthstone and waiting in front of the 1st pick.
* Drafting doesn't advance to next card.
 * Once you start an arena draft you cannot move hearthstone window until the end of the draft.
 * After picking a card move the mouse to the zone below or above the card so the next one can be read.
 * After picking a card make sure you don't move the mouse to the place of any of the other 2 cards or the program can take any of those as selected.
* What does it mean when cards in the decklist are highlighted in yellow?
 * Minions are shown in white.
 * Spells and weapons are shown in yellow.
* How do I reset the app so I can set the config info again?
 * With the app selected press ctrl+alt+r
* I setup the app but didn't upload my arena game.
 * Did you forget to restart Hearthstone after the initial config of Arena Tracker?
* I get "File: ERROR:Saving card image to disk. Make sure HSCards dir is in the same place as the exe." or "File: ERROR:Cannot find arenaTemplate.png. Make sure HSCards dir is in the same place as the exe."
 * Make sure HSCards dir is in the same dir as the binary.
